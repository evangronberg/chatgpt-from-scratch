Also read the following article on sinusoidal positional encodings:

## Question 1

In the readings, we see an old version of a positional encoding (sine function) and an even older version of word embeddings (word2vec). What are the pros and cons of learning these embeddings directly as opposed to a pre-defined/pre-learned embedding as described in the readings?
